1) How do I approach designing software? What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft? What design process did you follow for your project work? How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

For designing software, I try and take it one step at a time. For instance I see a larger problem and then I break it down into more manageable problems in order to define a more structured coding creation. One of the major design skills that helped me work on the project was drawing down my vectors in addition to drawing my points on a graph. These design approaches can help me in my future work as being able to draw said objects will make it more manageable when structuring in the future. 


2) How do I approach developing programs?
   What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
   How did iteration factor into your development?
   How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?


3) How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
   How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
   How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
